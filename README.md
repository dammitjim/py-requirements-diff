# Requirements diff
Quick and dirty script to compare a git diff of a requirements.txt file for including in changelogs.

Could this have been done using fancy shell commands? Yeah probably.

# Install

* go install github.com/dammitjim/py-requirements-diff

# Usage
```bash
git diff {version} requirements/common.txt | py-requirements-diff -prefix="* "

// i want it sorted 
git diff {version} requirements/common.txt | py-requirements-diff -prefix="* " | sort

// i have a file instead 
py-requirements-diff -prefix="* " diff.txt | sort
```

## Example output

```bash
âŸ© git diff 2.41.0 requirements/common.txt | py-requirements-diff | sort
